# The Prime Directive

Finding prime numbers is a common technical challenge in programming interviews.

As it happens, Java loops are a great tool to help you do this!

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.

Your prime directive: Build a PrimeDirective.java program that creates an ArrayList of all prime numbers in an array.

# Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a common developer interview question; so common it’s almost cliché!

The challenge is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve coding problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Numbers replaced with Fizz and Buzz as appropriate.
Write a FizzBuzz.java program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100… with a catch:

For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
